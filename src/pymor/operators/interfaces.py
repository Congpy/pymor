    '''Interface for parameter dependent discrete operators.

    Every discrete operator is viewed as a map ::

    Attributes
    ----------
    dim_source
        The dimension s of the source space.
    dim_range
        The dimension r of the range space.
    type_source
        The `VectorArray` class representing vectors of the source space.
    type_range
        The `VectorArray` class representing vectors of the range space.

        Parameters
        ----------
        U : VectorArray
            `VectorArray` of vectors to which the operator is applied.
        ind
            If None, the operator is applied to all elements of U.
            Otherwise an iterable of the indices of the vectors to
            which the operator is to be applied.

        Returns

        Parameters
        ----------
        V : VectorArray
            Left arguments.
        U : VectorArray
            Right arguments.
        V_ind
            If None, the operator is applied to all elements of V.
            Otherwise an iterable of the indices of the vectors to
            which the operator is to be applied.

        product
            `Operator` representing the scalar product.
            If None, the euclidean product is chosen.
        pairwise
            If False and V and U are multi-dimensional, then form is applied
            to all combinations of vectors in V and U, i.e. ::

                L.apply2(V, U).shape = (len(V_ind), len(U_ind)).

            If True, the vectors in V and U are applied in pairs, i.e. ::

        Returns

        A numpy array of all operator evaluations.
